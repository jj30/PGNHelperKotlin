# PGNHelperKotlin
The PGNHelper, but translated into Kotlin. I will release it to the play store soon (I am looking at Google database and storage options).

The SQLite database in this repo has ten games -- the ten most famous chess games ever, according to [this web site](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/famous-chess-games-611396).

01
McDonnell vs. La Bourdonnais (1834)

02
Anderssen vs. Kieseritzky (1851)

03
Anderssen vs. Dufresne (1852)

04 
Morphy vs. Duke of Brunswick/Count Isouard (1858)

05
Levitsky vs. Marshall (1912) 

06
Bogoljubov vs. Alekhine (1922)

07
Byrne vs. Fischer (1956)

08 
Deep Blue vs. Kasparov (1996) 

09 
Kasparov vs. Topalov (1999)

10 
Anand vs. Topalov (2005) 

The above games are interesting to chess players and can even be found by tagnames used by chess fans, such as
"The Immortal Game" (Anderssen vs. Kieseritzsky, #1 in the above list), "The Evergreen Game" (Anderssen vs. Dufresne, #3 above),
"23rd Century Chess" (Anand vs. Topalov, #10), or "The Game of the Century" (Fischer vs. Byrne, #7).

In "The Game of the Century", Fischer was 13 years old, playing against Byrne, who was 26. Watch this painful double-attack on Byrne's queen and rook, brought on by the discovered check from Fischer's bishop at c4:

And, of course, the game ended in a most humbling defeat for Donald Byrne.
